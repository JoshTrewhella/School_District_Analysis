# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
During our meeting with Maria, she asked us to assist in analyzing the data of the schools in her district, and present the data in table format. We are to include the performance of each school based on math and reading scores along with the the budget, size, and type of each school. Due to academic dishonesty, we were asked to replace the reading and math scores for Thomas High School with NaNs and analyze how the outcomes were effected.
